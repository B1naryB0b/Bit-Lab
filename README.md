This is a vault of information on anything game dev. I'm hoping to make this the birth place of a community focused on bringing together the vast amounts of game development resources onto a single, easy to navigate, easy to understand, website.

This site was built using the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) and deployed on vercel.
