 This is a **vault of information on anything game dev**. I'm hoping to make this the birth place of a community focused on bringing together the vast amounts of game development resources onto a single, easy to navigate, easy to understand, website. Its also a home for my dev logs.

The knowledge repository is built in Obsidian in a Wiki style with **links between topics, clear tags, examples and links to external resources**.
