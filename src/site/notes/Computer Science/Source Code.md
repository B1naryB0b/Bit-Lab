This is code written in high-level programming languages (e.g. [[IRL Programming/Programming Languages/Python\|python]], [[IRL Programming/Programming Languages/C++\|C++]], [[IRL Programming/Programming Languages/C Sharp\|C#]], [[IRL Programming/Programming Languages/Java\|Java]] etc) by humans. **Anything that is human readable, with or without comments, and is displayed in plain text, is source code.**

Source code often needs to be translated by a [[Computer Science/Complier\|compiler]] into [[Computer Science/Binary\|machine code]] for a computer to be able to read and execute it.
