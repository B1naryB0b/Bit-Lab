```ad-tldr
A data structure is just a way of storing and organising data so it can be used efficiently. **That's it.**

The difficult of data structures comes from picking the right one for your use case and learning techniques to make the most of the data structure you pick.
```

# Primitive

These are [[Computer Science/Variables\|variable]] data types that act as the building blocks of data structures. They are chained or allocated in groups to create any of the more complex objects like [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Array\|Array]] or [[Computer Science/Data Structures/List\|List]] and many others.

Primitive data structures includes stuff like:
- Booleans
- Integers
- Floats
- Characters
- Strings (basically an array of characters in a trench coat)
- Pointers

# Nonprimitive

Nonprimitive data structures fall into two camps, linear and nonlinear. Lots of nons going around.
## Linear

These are data structures that are arranged in sequence, one after the other like [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Array\|arrays]], [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Stack\|stacks]] or [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Queue\|queues]]. They are often quite simple and intuitive, and although they are more simple to implement, their time complexity scales with the amount of data they are holding. So depending on the
