```ad-tldr
Nodes are a basic data structure composed of two parts:
- The data in the node (this can be any [[Variables|variable]])
- Links to other nodes
```

# Larger Structures

Nodes can be used to create larger data structures such as [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Linked List\|linked lists]], [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Graph\|graphs]] and [[Computer Science/Data Structures/Tree\|trees]]. You can traverse these structures by going form one node to another by looking at the nodes they point to.
