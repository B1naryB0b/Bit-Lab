Some programming languages like [[Software Development/Programming Languages/Python\|python]] don't need you to declare the data type when you initialise it, although under the hood they still use variable types.

Here are examples of some variables:
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Integers\|Integers]]

```cpp
int age = 22;
```
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Floats\|Floats]]

```cpp
float height = 183.5f;
```
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Booleans\|Booleans]]

```cpp
bool canProgramme = true;
```
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Characters\|Characters]]

```cpp
char favouriteLetter = 'Q';
```
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Strings\|Strings]]

```cpp
string password = "password123";
```

> [!danger]
> Please never set your password to `password123`, you **WILL** get hacked.
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Pointers\|Pointers]]

```cpp
bool* ptr = &canProgramme;
```

# [[Computer Science/Variables/References\|References]]

```cpp

```
# [[Computer Science/Variables/Consts\|Consts]] 

```cpp
const float speedOfLight = 299792458;
```
