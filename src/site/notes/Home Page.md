# Hi, welcome to Bit Lab!

**This is a vault of information on anything game dev.** I'm hoping to make this the birth place of a community focused on bringing together the vast amounts of game development resources onto a single, easy to navigate, easy to understand, website.

There is lots of gold out there for those that know where to look, but it is often a long and tedious journey to find all of those pockets of gold scattered all over the internet. **From GDC, Brackeys, Code Monkey, Unreal Sensei and many, many more.**

I (and anyone willing to join me on my torturous quest) will try to cover a range of topics in game development and adjacent fields. To see the full list, check the side bar.

One thing to note, although I will do my best to keep the information as high quality as possible, there will inevitably be mistakes in the Bit Lab. If that is the case please [[Contact\|contact me]] and I'll try to quickly resolve and correct any issues that arise from this.
