# Hi, welcome to Bit Lab!

**This is a vault of information on anything game dev.** I'm hoping to make this the birth place of a community focused on bringing together the vast amounts of game development resources onto a single, easy to navigate, easy to understand, website.

There is lots of gold out there for those that know where to look, but it is often a long and tedious journey to find all of those pockets of gold scattered all over the internet. **From GDC, Brackeys, Code Monkey, Unreal Sensei and many, many more.**

# Where to start?

If you are unsure, **check out the [[Bit Hubs/Nooblets Guide\|Nooblets Guide]] for an idea of what to do.** It contains links to many of the most useful info for budding new developers. Otherwise, just poking around in the sidebar or the graph view is also a great place to start.

# Looking for something specific?

Use the **search function in the sidebar/header (shortcut is CTRL + K)** and type in what you are looking for, if you are luck it might already be inside the Bit Lab. If what you are looking for is a bit more... wishy washy, a pixel art technique you just can't remember the name of, or Lico? Lisov? Li... something substitution principle. You get the picture, **try using the [[Bit Hubs/Tags\|tags]] to find what you are looking for.**

# Looking for updates on my games?

**Check out the devlog section** for any updates on the games I'm currently working on. Many of them have **in-depth technical explanations** of how I went about building a particular feature as well as **resources to build something similar.**

I'm currently working on #void-serpent so click on the tag to find info related to the game.

# Want to help?

I (and anyone willing to join me on my torturous quest) will try to cover a range of topics in game development and adjacent fields. I would be more than **open to contributions from individuals from any part of the game dev community**, be it Gameplay Testers, QA folks, YouTube Dev Loggers, AAA Veterans or even a hobbyist who just likes to join game jams. **Everyone is welcome!**

**If you are interested in helping out, [[Bit Hubs/Contact\|contact me]].** 

I am planning to setup a discord around the Bit Lab if there are more users and contributors, so you might see a discord link here soon.

# Spot a mistake?

Although I and any contributors do our best to keep the information as high quality as possible, there will inevitably be mistakes in the Bit Lab. If that is the case **please [[Bit Hubs/Contact\|contact me]] and I'll try to quickly resolve and correct any issues** that arise from this.
