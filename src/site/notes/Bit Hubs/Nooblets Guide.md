# Crawling comes before running!

>For brand new developers it is a massive temptation to start running before learning how to crawl. You will be learning to fight that temptation at all times.

*What does that mean?*

Beginner game developers often fall into **the trap of looking at games that they play, the ones made by dozens or even hundreds of highly seasoned developers, and thinking that their first game will be comparable.** Hell, even fairly experienced developers often overestimate their capabilities or the amount of time it will take to finish building a game.

So if you can't make the next Call of Duty or World of Warcraft, *what can you make?*

For the average new game developer, one with minimal coding experience and has never made a game before, **realistically, pong.** If you haven't heard of pong, it is a game with two controllable paddles consisting of white boxes, you can move them up and down to bounce a small white ball between them, whichever side manages to get the ball past the opposite sides paddle wins a point.

**Those of you who immediately scoff at the idea of making such a simple game have already fallen into the trap.**

If you've made it this far then I hope the section above acts as fair warning to new game developers, but know that despite how hard it can be at times, **game development is also one of the most interesting, exciting and rewarding things you can do.**

# The beginners crossroad

**I try my best to make the resources here independent of which programming languages you use or what game engine you work in.** This is so that whatever you learn can be applied to a whole range of projects rather than a select few in specific languages and engines. Although there are language and engine specific content, **I recommend starting out with broadly applicable topics** and often provide examples in whichever language best illustrates something.

Here are some of my recommended starting points:
