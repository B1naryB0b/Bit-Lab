```ad-cite
title: Wikipedia Article
Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name _git_ (which means "unpleasant person" in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English "British English") slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First '[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel")', now 'git'."[31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#cite_note-whythegitname-32)[32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#cite_note-33) The [man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page "Man page") describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#cite_note-34)

The [read-me file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README "README") of the source code elaborates further:[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#cite_note-35)

> "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.
> 
> - Random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
> - Stupid. Contemptible and despicable. Simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
> - "Global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
> - "Goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.

The source code for Git refers to the program as "the information manager from hell".
