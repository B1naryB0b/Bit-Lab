# 300% Mortality Rate 

Gordon describes what he calls Liston's most famous case in his book, as quoted verbatim below.

Amputated the leg in under $2 \frac{1}{2}$ minutes (the patient died afterwards in the ward from [hospital gangrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_gangrene "Hospital gangrene"); they usually did in those [pre-Listerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lister "Joseph Lister") days). He amputated in addition the fingers of his young assistant (who died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene). He also slashed through the coat tails of a distinguished surgical spectator, who was so terrified that the knife had pierced his vitals he fainted from fright (and was later discovered to have died from shock).

— Richard Gordon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Liston#cite_note-RichardGordon15-32)

This episode has since been dubbed as the only known surgery in history with a 300 percent mortality rate.
